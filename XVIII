Shall I compare thee to a Wednesday?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds that day,
And mid-week's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
